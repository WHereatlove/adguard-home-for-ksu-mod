[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | **English**

- Based on Twoone3's work, with added methods to disable ads by deleting/occupying ad folders
- Built-in 8680 blocking rules with support for custom rules
- Refactored almost all underlying scripts for lower latency, better performance, and power optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Notice ‚Äì Please Read
- May interfere with coupon redemption functionality in some apps (not a false positive)
- May prevent reward systems based on watching ads (not a false positive)
- Some services (e.g., Baidu) bundle ads with financial products ‚Äì blocking may affect those features
- Do **not** use with other similar ad-blocking modules
- Cannot block ads served from the same domain as content (e.g., QQ, WeChat, Alipay)
## Advantages Over Other Solutions
### vs. Private DNS
1. No server dependency ‚Üí no downtime or overload issues
2. Lower latency ‚Äì processing happens locally
3. Better privacy ‚Äì no data sent to third-party servers
### vs. Hosts File
1. Encrypted DNS (DoH) support
2. Prevents DNS hijacking
3. Harder to detect and block
### vs. Accessibility-based Ad Skippers (e.g., Li Tiao Tiao)
1. No background process killing issues
2. No UI lag or performance drain
3. Lightweight and battery-efficient
4. No package name detection risks
### vs. LSPosed Modules
1. Less detectable ‚Äì no app hooking or injection
2. Broader coverage ‚Äì blocks ads system-wide, not per-app
## üìñ Tutorial ‚Äì Read Before Use
- Disable or uninstall other ad-blocking modules, proxy tools, accessibility services, VPN ad blockers, browser ad blockers, private DNS, and modules like Scene, iWanJi Toolbox, ZN-Audit-Patch, Zygisk-Sui, etc.
- If ads aren't blocked, try clearing the app‚Äôs cache and data, then restarting it
- Magisk users: Click the gear icon next to the module to access the Web UI manager
- If using Clash Meta, disable system proxy in Network settings (tested and working)
